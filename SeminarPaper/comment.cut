  I would like to express my gratitude to those who helped me with the process of creating this report as well as the
  accompanying presentation. Firstly, I would like to thank Peter Dolan, my senior seminar advisor. He provided me with
  the experience, expertise and wisdom required to put together both this paper and the presentation. I would also like
  to thank my external reviewer, Brian Mitchell. Brian provided me with very beneficial input that I used to refine and improve
  this paper. Lastly, I would like to acknowledge all of the Computer Science faculty members who have helped give periodic input
  on the paper and the presentation as well as refining my knowledge in the discipline.
