An example of using LaTeX and BibTeX to create a paper
using the format we want for the course.

There's a lot of useful examples of how to use LaTeX in
`sample_paper.tex`, and examples of BibTeX formatting in
`sample_paper.bib`.

Our recommendation is to copy `sample_paper.tex` to something
that makes more sense for your setting, like `lamberty.tex`
or `face_generation_using_GANs.tex`. You probably also want
to make a copy of `sample_paper.bib`, or at least rename it.

`sample_paper.tex` should build successfully "as is". If it
doesn't or you have any problems with it, definitely let us
know.
